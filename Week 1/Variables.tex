    \section{Variables}
    Variables are used to store information in memory while your program is executing. To create a variable, you must
first declare it.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A declaration of a variable is where a program says that it needs a variable.
        \item The declaration gives a name and a data type for the variable.
        \item A variable cannot be used in a program unless it has been declared.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{lstlisting}
    public class Program {
        public static void main (String args[]){
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }\end{lstlisting}
